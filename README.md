## About my tasks

I would say that the tasks were really interesting and at the same time some were challenging (Well! i couldn't complete few). While completing each task i learned alot like how to approach new problems, languages and several ways to overcome errors also, never used Google extensively like this before XD. I was able to identify myself some parts which seems to be difficult and i will work on those in future, eventually improve!! I completed the given tasks as much as earlier so that i can go back to my learning track(Full stack development).

## Who's me?

I am from, was born, brought up in Madurai. I took Computer Science as my Major in high school and now CSE at Amrita University, i was a noob content creator and App developer since my 9th grade. I love to code and like to build some cool stuffs which helps in one way or the other. I was a Youtuber and had my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnal_HZ0TRo3A6CmC71v5Xw">Youtube channel</a> with 15k subscribers which is not related to Tech but still, i love it and due to studies and some personal issues(solo player though!) at that time i couldn't continue further with it. My passion towards technology is infinite and i'm an Aspiring Full-Stack and iOS Developer, also started working towards it. I'm fond of participating in various inter/intra school competitions, Hackathons, Fest, Workshops and also hosted competition/events in my School days. Though I won only few competitions(mostly runnerup/finalist), but still trying is better than giving-up right!? so my hunting never ends. I was head of my school CS Club and also Technical team lead. Atlast here we are, amFOSS seems to be the ideal place to help myself out to have a better knowledge on things I like and make myself a better person as well.You can also checkout my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q1YOgRjZdjTYxgizw6zgTZj0mddSaYl7/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (though it's not a proper one, still worth checking!).
