I'm new to Competitive Programming and These tasks was really challenging, took hours for completing atleast for me.I had some previous experience in Python as it was a part of my syllabus in high school and also i have pretty basic knowledge in C++ too. Since I was familiar with both Python and C++ i used them to solve these sub tasks. I successfully finished all the sub tasks though some were ended up in tragedy as i couldn't complete the all tasks with maximum points.Hope i would do better in Future!
